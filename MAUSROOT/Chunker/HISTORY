######################### CHUNKER HISTORY ###########################
#####################################################################

0.1	Imported source files from old repository and created
	wrapper script, README and Config files.

0.2	- In Version 0.1, the chunker defaulted to a zerogram 
	language model regardless of the language model option set.
	This bug, which led to poor performance particularly on some
	languages is now fixed.
	- Refactored a number of classes in the source code.
	- Added French benchmark (fra-FR.short).

0.3	- Added --force option
	- Added sampa benchmark (sampa.short)
	- CEPLIFTER option added to HCopy feature extraction
	- Fixed a bug that meant that in cases where bpf == outfile,
	the output was only partial.

0.4	- Fixed error handling by wrapper script.
	- Some changes to README.

0.5	- Fixed a bug that led to a seg fault in cases where the KAN
	tier's first entry is a tag or pause.
	- Moved this History section to a separate file HISTORY.
	- Help page now lists all available languages.
	- Set MAXNUMTHREADS option default to 1 in master.config.

0.6	- version is now outputted to stdout (was stderr before)

0.7	- Fixed a bug that led to a seg fault in the boost phase
	in cases where the KAN tier's first entry is an unknown
	tag (0.5 had only fixed cases of known tags such as <p:>)

0.8	- The chunker now gets audio duration information from
	its internal downsampled file (and not the original
	file provided by the user). This should prevent issues
	in cases where the original audio is corrupted (e.g
	by a premature EOF).
	- Reduced boost_minanchorlength to 4. Reason: Without
	multithreading, the chunker gets really slow in cases
	where the boost phase falls through, with runtimes
	above the timeout limit. This measurs should prevent 
	this from happening too often. Users with high-risk 
	input (e.g. incompletely transcribed audio files) will 
	have to turn the boost phase off for now.

0.9	- Added --insymbols parameter. If set to ipa, the chunker
	now accepts IPA symbols (provided that they are in map
	/usr/local/maus.root/PARAM.SAMPA/KANINVENTAR.inv) 
	- Benchmark is now also testing the fast aligner

0.10	- Bugfix: SAM entry in BPF was always 16000; now it
	corresponds to the actual sampling rate of the input
	audio

0.11	- Fix for windows users: Chunker can now handle input
	with carriage returns

0.12	- Command line arguments can now be passed as --arg value
	or -arg value. Also, --version/-version and --help/-help
	are now equivalent. Changed benchmark so that this is
	tested.

0.13	- Fix: Chunker now reads KANINVENTAR instead of GRAPH-
	INVENTAR when parsing BPF. This bug led to errors in a
	few languages such as Hungarian.

0.14	- Fixed a bug that meant that the --maxchunkduration
	parameter did not work correctly

0.15	- If --outtype is bpf+trn, the LHD header tag is added
	if it is not already present
	- Bugfix: Mistake with priority-based order of chunk
	boundaries
